# Running jobs
{: #kn-job-deploy}

Learn how to run jobs in Coligo. Jobs in Coligo are meant to run to completion as batch or standalone executables. They are not intended to provide lasting endpoints to access like a Coligo application does.
{: shortdesc}

## Create a job definition
{: #create-job-def}

Jobs, unlike applications which react to incoming HTTP requests, are meant to be used for running container images that contain an executable designed to run one time and then exit. Rather than specifying the full configuration of a job each time it is executed, you can create a *job definition* which acts as a "template" for the job.

When you run a job, you can override many of the variables that you set in the template. You can create job definitions from the console or with the CLI.

{: shortdesc}

### Creating a job definition from the console
{: #create-job-def-ui}

Before you begin, [create a project](/docs/knative?topic=knative-manage-project).  

1. After your project is in **Active** status, click the name of your project on the Projects page.
2. From the Components page, click **Job definition** to create the job definition.
3. From the Create job definition page, provide a name for your job definition and a container image.  You can also modify default runtime settings. 
4. Click **Create**. 

### Creating a job definition with the CLI
{: #create-job-def-cli}

Before you begin:

* [Create and work with a project](/docs/knative?topic=knative-manage-project)
* Set up your [Coligo CLI](/docs/knative?topic=knative-kn-install-cli) environment

To create a job definition with the CLI, run the `ibmcloud coligo jobdef create` command. This command requires a name and an image and also allows other optional arguments. 

The following example creates a job definition named `testjobdef` that uses the container image `ibmcom/testjob`. 

```
ibmcloud coligo jobdef create --image ibmcom/testjob --name testjobdef 
```

## Running a job
{: #run-job}

After you create your job definitions, you can use that definition to describe the parameters for your job. You can override some parameters that are defined by the job definition. Run your job from the console or with the CLI.
{: shortdesc}

### Running a job from the console
{: #run-job-ui}

Before you begin, [create a job definition from the console](#create-job-def).

1. Navigate to your job definition page. For example:
   * From the [Coligo Projects page](https://cloud.ibm.com/knative/projects){: external}, click the name of your Project to open the Components page.  
   * From the Components page, click the name of the job definition that you want to run your job. If you do not have any job definitions defined, [create a job definition](#create-job-def).


3. From your job definition page, click **Submit Job** to run a job based on the selected job definition configuration. 
4. From the Submit job pane, review and optionally change configuration values such as array size, CPU, memory, number of job retries and job timeout. **Array size** specifies the number of instances or containers to run your job. 
5. Click **Submit job** to run your job. The system displays the status of the instances of your job on the job details page.

You can view job logs after you add logging capabilities. See [adding log capabilities](#enable-joblogs-ui) and [viewing job logs from the console](#view-joblogs-ui)for more information. 
{: tip}

### Running a job with the CLI
{: #run-job-cli}

Before you begin:

* Set up your [Coligo](/docs/knative?topic=knative-kn-install-cli) environment
* [Create a job definition](#create-job-def-cli).

To run a job with the CLI, use the `ibmcloud coligo job run` command. The following example creates three new pods to run the container image specified in the `testjobdef` job definition. The resource limits and requests are applied per pod, so each of the pods gets 128 MB memory and 1 vCPU. This array job allocates 5 \* 128 MiB = 640 MiB memory and 5 \* 1 vCPU = 5 vCPUs.

```
ibmcloud coligo job run --name testjobrun --jobdef testjobdef --arraysize 5 --retrylimit 2 
```

## Accessing the job details
{: #access-job-details}

Find details about your job from the console or with the CLI.
{: shortdesc}

View job details in the console by clicking on the name of your job in the Jobs pane on your job definition page. Job details include status of your instances, configuration details, and environmental variables of your job. 

To view job details with the CLI, use the `ibmcloud coligo job get` command.  For example, `ibmcloud coligo job get --name hello`.

### Job status
{: #job-status}

The following table shows the possible status that your job might have.

| Status | Description |
| ------ | ------------|
| Pending | The Job has been accepted by the system, but one or more of the instances of the job has not been created yet. This status includes time before being scheduled as well as time spent downloading images over the network, which might take a while. |
| Running | The Job instances have been created. At least one instance is still running, or is in the process of starting or restarting. |
| Succeeded | All Job instances have terminated in success, and will not be restarted. |
| Failed | All Job instances have terminated, and at least one instance has terminated in failure. That is, the instance either exited with non-zero status or was terminated by the system.
| Unknown |	For some reason the state of the Job could not be obtained, typically due to an error in communicating with the host. |

### Accessing job details from the console
{: #access-jobdetails-ui}

Job results are available in the console from the job details page after submitting your job. You can also view job details in the console by clicking on the name of your job in the Jobs pane on your job definition page. Job details include status of your instances, configuration details, and environmental variables of your job.  

### Accessing job details with the CLI
{: #access-jobdetails-cli}

## Viewing job logs
{: #view-job-logs}

After your job has completed, view the logs for information on your completed job.
{: shortdesc}

### Viewing job logs from the console
{: #view-joblogs-ui}

Coligo uses {{site.data.keyword.la_full}} for log management capabilities. You can access logs for jobs that are run in the console  from your job details page. 

#### Enabling job logs from the console
{: #enable-joblogs-ui}

If you want to view logs for your job from the console, enable logging before you run your job. 

You only need to enable logging for Coligo one time per region, per account.
{: important}



1. After running a job using your job definition, the system displays the status of the instances of your job on the job details page. If logging capabilities are not set, the **Add logging** option is displayed.  When logging capabilties are set, the job details page displays **Launch logging** instead of **Add logging**.
2. Click **Add logging** on the job definition page to create a log instance for your region. 
3. From the LogDNA page, specify a region, review pricing information and select your plan, and review LogDNA resource information.

  Review the [service plan](/docs/Log-Analysis-with-LogDNA?topic=LogDNA-service_plans) information as you consider retention, search, and log usage needs.
  {: tip}

4. Click **Create** to create the logging instance.
5. Configure platform logs using one of the following ways:  

  * After you **Submit job** to run your job, click **Add logging** from the job details page. Select an IBM Log Analysis with LogDNA instance to receive platform logs. Select an instance for your region and click **Configure**.

  * [Configure platform logs](/docs/Log-Analysis-with-LogDNA?topic=LogDNA-config_svc_logs#config_svc_logs_ui) from the [Observability dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/observe/logging). Click **Configure platform logs**. Select an IBM Log Analysis with LogDNA instance to receive platform log data by specifying a region and your log instance. Click **Configure**.

6. (Optional) To confirm that platform logs are set for your region, check the [Observability dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/observe/logging). 

7. Now that logging is enabled on the console for Coligo, whenever you [run a job](#run-job-ui), you can click **Launch logging** from the job details page to open the  the job definition page displays **Logging** instead of **Add logging**.  Click **Logging** to open the LogDNA page for all jobs that are run using this job definition.

After enabling logging, consider keeping the LogDNA window open to easily view your job log data.
{: tip}

### Viewing job logs with the CLI
{: #view-joblog-cli}

To view job logs with the CLI, use the `ibmcloud coligo job logs` command. 

For example, to view the logs for our `testjobrun` job, use the command: 

```
ibmcloud coligo job logs --name testjobrun
