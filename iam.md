# Managing user access
{: #knative-iam}

Access to Coligo service instances for users in your account is controlled by {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Identity and Access Management (IAM). Every user that accesses the Coligo service in your account must be assigned an access policy with an IAM role defined. The policy determines what actions a user can perform within the context of the service or instance that you select. The allowable actions are customized and defined by the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} service as operations that are allowed to be performed on the service. The actions are then mapped to IAM user roles. 
{: shortdesc}

Coligo uses both the Platform and Service management roles. You can set policies about who can create a project at the platform level, and use the service roles to manage interaction with the project itself. As the creator of a project, you do not need to set any IAM policies to view or work with your Coligo entities.

### How do I set IAM policies so that others can work with my project?
{: #iam_project_policies}

In order for others to work with entities in your project, you must to set the appropriate [IAM policies in the console](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/overview){: external} or the [IAM CLI](#cli-pol-set). 

The minimum Platform level access is Viewer. The minimum Service level access is Reader. For more information about Platform and Service level access roles, see [Platform management roles](#iam_platform_roles) and [Service-specific roles](#service_specific_roles).

{: tip}

### How do I set IAM policies so that others can create a project in my account?

In order to allow other users to manage Colgio properties, including creating properties, you must set the following access policies for those users.

  * The user's **Platform role** must be set to Administrator. This policy applies to all resources of Coligo.
  * The user's **Service role**  must be set to Manager. This policy applies to all resources of Coligo.

### How do I know which access policies have set for me?

You can see which access policies have been set for you in the [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog){: external} console.

1. Go to [Access IAM users](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/users){: external}.
2. Click your name in the user table.
3. Click the **Access policies** tab to see your access policies.

## Assigning access roles
{: #iam_access_roles}

Policies enable access to be granted at different levels. Some of the options include the following: 

* Access across all instances of the service in your account
* Access to an individual service instance in your account
* Access to a specific resource within an instance

After you define the scope of the access policy, you assign a role, which determines the user's level of access. Review the following tables that outline what actions each role allows within the Coligo service.

### Platform management roles
{: #iam_platform_roles}

The following table details actions that are mapped to platform management roles. Platform management roles enable users to perform tasks on service resources at the platform level, for example, assign user access for the service, create or delete instances, and bind instances to applications.

| Platform management role | Description of actions | 
|--------------------------|------------------------|
| Viewer                   | Description            |
| Editor                   | View dashboard            |
| Operator                 | View dashboard            | 
| Administrator            | View dashboard            |
{: caption="Table 1. IAM user roles and actions" caption-side="top"}

### Service-specific roles
{: #service_specific_roles}

The following table details actions that are mapped to service access roles. Service access roles enable users access to `service name` and the ability to call the `service name's` API.

| Service access role | Description of actions | 
|---------------------|------------------------|
| Reader              | Read tenant and tenant entities, but cannnot modify            | 
| Writer              | Create, read, update, and delete tenant entities; read tenant            |
| Manager             | Create, read, update, and delete tenant entities; read tenant            |

For information about assigning user roles in the console, see [Managing access to resources](/docs/iam?topic=iam-iammanidaccser#iammanidaccser).

### Setting access policies for a user with the CLI
You can set an access policies for a specific users by using the following command. In this example `name@example.com` is assigned the Viewer role for Coligo. This means that users with the Viewer role can access all of your Coligo properties.
{: #cli-pol-set}

```
ibmcloud iam user-policy-create name@example.com --roles Viewer --service-name coligo
```
